2004-05-06 v0.8.8 Johannes Berg, Richard B Winston, Carl Eric Codere
 + fix a lot of tiny bugs, range check errors, etc
 + implement consolidation for // style comments so that you can now
   use // style comments in multiple lines like this:
   // @abstract(something)
   // and a real comment
   and both lines will be added to the documentation.
 + @longcode tag implemented (fixes bug #802469)
 + \LaTeX output

2003-11-20 v0.8.8-pre6 Johannes Berg
 + fix 3 logged bugs
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-842325 ] bug in function IsMacro
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-844324 ] tag "returns" very together does not insert a jump of line
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-844325 ] The tag "return" does not work, "returns" with "s" if
 + corrected output of @raises tag (last character could be cut off)
 + javi fixed and updated the Spanish translation
 + added proper warning for FPC operator overloading as it is not supported
   right now. TODO item: write a ParseOperator function
 + added support for FreePascal inline "calling convention"

2003-05-14 v0.8.8-pre4 Thomas Mueller
 + more CSS
 + code cleanup
 + if class has no description, write ancestor's description and
   a warning
 + reordering by visibility
 + @param, @returns, @raises except argument in parentheses now

2003-05-09 v0.8.8-pre3 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + write complete known hierarchy in class descriptions
 - remove calling hhc.exe, you should do this from a script
 + fixed HTML-Help output
 + fixed numeric name creation wrt. cross-links
   (there was a rather BAD bug, now all numbers are
    sequential too!)
 + automatically turn on numeric filenames for HTML help because
   hhc chokes on extra dots in filenames
 + bugfix: "~" is a valid character in a URL

2003-05-02 v0.8.8-pre2 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + better HTML output with CSS
 + HTML output has new section links
 + fix hierarchy: objects descend from TObject,
   interfaces with GUID are now shown properly

2003-05-01 v0.8.8-pre1 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + hierarchy is shown properly with everything
 + name directive for imported functions parsed properly
 + proper HTML entity encoding

2003-04-20 v0.8.7 Johannes Berg/Thomas Mueller
Based on Ralf Junker's changes, I did the following:
 + added enumerated type parsing
 + made work with FPC
 + records (handled like classes), 
   + case statements in records
   + nested records
 + spell-checker for linux (currently disabled, use an older CVS file
   of RunHelp to use under Kylix, will not work in FPC, need advice)
 + new option-parser
 + uses delphi streams instead of files. Supposedly does not work
   on all platforms FPC runs on - need advice
 + commentmarker (for example only {: comments )
 + declarations like
   "var a: function(x,y,z:Integer):Integer cdecl = nil" 
   are parsed correctly
 + dependency plotting with GraphViz (AT&T )
   (not very useful)
 + uses clause will be included in doc (optional)
 + links "http://", "ftp://" etc. are recognized automatically
 + varargs directive
 + abbreviations "@author(johannes)" can be expanded
   to @author(Johannes Berg <...>) via abbreviatons file
 + @cvs($Date ...$), @cvs($Author ...$) is recognized and
   used for lastmod / author
   + duplicate authors skipped
 - name search doesn't look into classes any more,
   if a method reference is needed outside the current class
   then the class has to be specified:
   @link(class.method)
   (faster and less error-prone)
 + HTML output uses unitname.classname.html instead of numbers,
   but has option to make number-only-filenames (for short-name
   filesystems)
 + class member visibility can be specified in output
 + long option names (see PasDoc --help)
 + images are no longer carried in a .RES file but in include
   files instead, as constants in code, for FPC

Some time inbetween... (0.6.21 to 0.8.6) Ralf Junker
 - LaTeX documentation removed
 - see http://zeitungsjunge.de/delphi/PasDoc/History.htm for
   more information.

2000/04/20 v0.6.20 ms
- added Rodrigo Jardim's translations of pasdoc's output to Brasilian
  Portuguese; new switch -b (and --brasilian)
- increased STEP from 32 to 128 when reallocating description pointers,
  this makes pasdoc crash less with RTE 216; bug must still be fixed by
  changing GetMem's default behaviour

2000/04/17 v0.6.19 ms
- fixed bug that prevented pasdoc from skipping code until an $else
  conditional directive (thanks to Michael v. Canneyt for reporting
  this bug)

2000/04/12 v0.6.17 ms
- added Marc Weustinks Dutch translation to pasdoc; switch -m (or --dutch) now
  creates Dutch output
- successfully created docs on Delphi 5 rtl\win directory (222 seconds, 16 MB html
  files on a P-II 350, 256 MB RAM)

2000/04/09 v0.6.15 ms
- added Michael v.C.'s update of the tex unit (changed chapter/section/
  subsection nesting of LaTeX output)
- moved LoadDescriptionFile and LoadDescriptionFiles from main.TPasdoc to
  gendoc.TDocGenerator
- worked on external description file loading
- email addresses in author tags are now displayed as mailto links in HTML
  output
- hard-coded HTML colors in body element (already added colors for tables
  etc., as long as the whole thing is not CSS-based, it's better to have
  all colors defined so that unusual default colors of a browser won't ruin
  the overall impression)
- released 0.6.15

2000/04/08 v0.6.13 ms
- released 0.6.13

2000/04/06 v0.6.13 ms
- fixed bug that made pasdoc ignore a unit that has ). in a type declaration;
  in scanning.pas, ). was supposed to be a replacement for ] while it must be
  .)

- fixed LaTeX bug that kept pasdoc from converting identifiers that were not
  found in the list of items to output format style

- added -u DIR switch to make pasdoc search for include files

2000/04/04 v0.6.11 ms
- moved objects.pas to directory 'other'; will now use default objects unit from FPC
- for the time being, I stop trying to compile pasdoc with Delphi, there is some bug
  I am unable to trace; Delphi 5 compiles pasdoc without problems but crashes when
  running it on appinfo.pas between the second and third constant for no apparent
  reason; I will try to fix bugs that are more obvious in the near future...
- fixed bug that made default keyword after a property appear as a field of that class
  (thanks to Andre Jager for pointing this out)
- fixed bug that made pasdoc crash on an empty author tag: @author()
  (thanks to Michael Hess for finding and isolating (!) this!)
- made pasdoc skip property declaration; property parsing needs some work,
  I will do this soon

2000/04/03 v0.6.11 ms
- created sourceforge.net account; pasdoc is now at http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net
- modified homepage to have frames; single page has become too huge

2000/03/31 v0.6.11 ms
- on a totally unrelated note - I just passed my exam in theoretical computer
  science - woohooo! again some time to work on pasdoc...

2000/02/11 v0.6.10 ms
- changed directory structure of the pasdoc project (added src, bin, man etc.)
- added -v (or --verbosity) switch to be able to change the amount of output

2000/02/08 v0.6.10 ms
- added PDF version of manual to homepage, thanks to Martin Krumpolec

2000/02/07 v0.6.10 ms
- arguments in functions and procedures no longer become links if there is a

- removed tabularx environments from TTexDocGenerator (for LaTeX output)
- added equivalent long command line switches for most of the short ones
- added check that will detect unknown (=> invalid) command line switches and
  react on them with an error message
- received pasdoc DOS binaries sent in by Jean-Pierre Vial and created a 0.6.9
  DOS binaries release, then updated the homepage
- added IOResult check in TFileInputStream.Open in filestre.pas; no more crashing
  on non-existent files
- added explanation for non-unique identifiers to manual; may find a workaround
  for this later (bug?)
- fixed bug that made the time in HTML documents always be 00:00:00 with
  the Delphi pasdoc version

  characters in other languages

- added support for directive file switch -f

1999/04/18 v0.6.0 ms

  Delphi 4
- added CompVer unit to store compiler name / OS / bits
- moved TItem and descendants to new unit Items
- started adding support for interfaces (Delphi 3.0+ feature)

  moved TText from unit Parsing to new unit Texts

1999/02/11 v0.5.1 ms
- fixed several bugs
  - HTML links
  - property parsing

1998/12/10 v0.5.0 ms
- added "nogeneratorinfo" switch

1998/12/09 v0.5.0 ms
- continued work on ExpandDescription

1998/12/08 v0.5.0 ms
- first entry in this history file
- restarted work on pasdoc after 2-3 months...
- now pasdoc can only create one type of output each time it gets called,
  not multiple

  replacing of links and special characters is done in additional
  procedure TPasDoc.ExpandDescriptions to be called after
  TDocGenerator.BuildLinks and before TDocGenerator.WriteDocumentation
